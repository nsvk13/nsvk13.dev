# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post written in Markdown and rendered with **remark** and **rehype**.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Why use Markdown?

- **Simplicity**: The syntax is simple and easy to learn
- **Portability**: Files can be opened using virtually any application
- **Platform Independent**: Can be created on any device running any operating system

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

\`\`\`javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
\`\`\`

## What's Next?

In future posts, I'll be sharing:

1. Development tips and tricks
2. DevOps best practices
3. Project updates
4. Technical tutorials

Stay tuned for more content!
